### About the Project
First of all this is my first Python, Django project. This project has been created for software developers, they can create their own profile cards after signing up for the page. In this card, they can write their contact addresses, social media accounts, place of residence and CV in the information box. they can also create the languages they know for a separate box. Under full languages, there is a section where they can create their projectors. and finally there is the message box.

### Setup
Before starting the project, I did some research to see what I could do with django and phython, which I learned. Since I also wanted to be a software developer, I thought it would be good for developers to have a website that displays your profile. Before I started writing code right away, I drew a sketch of the website I'm going to make using excalica Draw, how it will look. as seen below.

#### first I drew what my homepage would look like

### Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

### React

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.
Building a website on the front end using React technology.
